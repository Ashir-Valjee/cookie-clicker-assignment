**Reflection**

**Cookie clicker v2**
This was our first react project! Its been a great learning experience, after this weekened a few things clicked and I appreciate the power of State a lot more for eg. In addition, i'm gradually improving my CSS skills as well which i think is really useful.

my wireframe is in the directory

Optional

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
I did have an issue with my reset button which essentially clears local storage. Occasionally, resetting causes my app to crash. This is due to some parts of local storage not being cleared on some occasions. Manually clearing local storage allows me to continue but its an annoying bug and i'm not sure why it occasionally occurs

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
The most useful info was the class workshops and demos. However there were a couple of things that did help. I really wanted to reformatting big numbers into shorthand. For example 1000000 to 1M, 1200 to 1.2k. There are quite a few different methods of doing this that i found. I also asked this to chat GPT and used its suggestion which worked well. Do you have any thoughts about this formatting function?

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

The rest button ive already mentioned. Also i tried setting background message and having a button to switch it off or on using State. However i encountered problems related to useEffect i think

What went really well and what could have gone better?
I liked how I organized by code this week. I think I was quite efficient with the code i used and how i structured it, please let me know. Also my understanding of react improved a lot
